# React Router v6 Nested Routes and Index Route Issue

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in React Router v6 when using nested routes and an index route.  The index route fails to render correctly upon navigating directly to the parent route. The issue is related to how React Router handles route matching and rendering in nested structures.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy implementation which exhibits unexpected behavior with nested routes. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to resolve the described issue and contains the corrected implementation.
